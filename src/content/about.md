Hi there! I'm Herve Rwigema. I'm person who tries to understand how things work and share what I learn.



I care a lot about clear communication. I think one of the most important skills you can develop is the ability to put your thoughts and ideas into words that others can follow. Right now I'm diving deep into blockchain and web3 and writing about it as I go. 

You can look at my explorations on [Substack](https://0xherve.substack.com), and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xherve). I also can't stay in one lane, so I get occasional tangents into other interests.

I'm not claiming to be an expert; I'm claiming to be curious. A lot of my early work is unimpressive — you're watching me learn to cook, and some dishes may not be properly seasoned. They'll get better over time.
